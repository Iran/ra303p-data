Information recent to the C&C2 Redalert Desktop Theme:

This Theme was made by Christopher Hlubek and can be 
used freely. (But if you think it looks you can also
send me some Money :)

Technichal Info:
Your System must have 16Bit Color-Dephth and 640*480 
Video-Mode. If the Icons don't look so pretty, you 
have not enough Colors for your Icons.
(Don't ask me how to change this :(

If you have Questions, new Ideas, want another
Background or you would send me some money,
